ğŸš¨ Adventurer Alert!
It's time to adapt and learn a new skill.

You've been using cat to look at files... but now it's time to try something different.
Use the command head to look at just the first 10 lines of a file.

Maybeâ€¦ just maybeâ€¦ you'll find something interesting hiding at the top!

ğŸ§  Hint:


(head filename)

Try it out and see what you discover! ğŸ‘€
